Demos how Spring Session Id can be added as an Annotation.
This means you can trace an entire user's session.

= Prerequisites

* Run OpenZipkin
* Run Redis on localhost and default port

= Trying the Sample

* Authenticate the user

+

[source,bash]
----
$ curl -v -u user:password http://localhost:3380/authenticate 2>&1 | grep x-auth-token
< x-auth-token: <some-id>
----

* Make Requests with the User making sure to replace `<some-id>` with the id from the output above

+

[source,bash]
----
$ curl -H "x-auth-token: <some-id>"  http://localhost:3380/
----

= TBD

* Hash the session id when adding as a span (ensure it is secured)
